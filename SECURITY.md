# Security Policy
## Notice
Due to the nature of Fortivo and libfortivo security issues are not expected to be common, since this software does not use the network, which tends to be the main entrypoint for attacks, the only
possible kind of security issues are logic errors in libfortivo or the crypto library that libfortivo does depend on

The following versions of Fortivo and libfortivo are currently being supported with security updates:
| Version | Supported          |
